        Given the great challenges looming over the world such as climate change, automation, socio-economic injustice, poverty, etc. and given that the current systems have a hard time dealing with all of this, the new systems will naturally emerge. Current system's increasing incapability of fulfilling the basic premises such as meeting people's needs and promoting the welfare of all… is resulting in new ways of doing things. Those new ways are created and will, increasingly so, be created. The old will eventually transition into new systems, new societies. New socioeconomic systems with greater inclusion and smarter democracy for greater public good. This is a story of the world's developments towards new cooperative social formations around the globe that will shape a new global order, a union, a new economic and cultural power for the betterment of all and the whole.

    <p>
        There are several examples of cooperative companies, societies, communities and economies. For example, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hkQlayz6SpuFhX2R87GRK3724TtllkwsotAVQeiBvpg/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rojava with their Democratic Confederalism</a>; Preston from UK and Cleaveland from US and their models; There is Mondragon cooperative in Spain; Regions in Italy practicing cooperative economy; Kibbutz communes in Israel, etc. With modern technology, such communities or societies can also be created virtually and borderlessly. Blockchain space is one of the leaders in decentralized governance and organization. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (or Community/Society) is the term worth researching. There are some existing partial developments of frameworks for governance powered by blockchain such as Bitnation, Aragon, The Commons Stack, etc. A new holistic framework and platform can be created and used across the world (offline and on), for more holistic communities and societies that meet all human needs for a thriving existence.

    <p>
        Now, imagine such social formations forming a global union and spreading further across the world. A new economic and cultural power that can, through collective power and critical mass, really push for positive developments for the whole world. This might be a possible and achievable dream. A dream worth exploring and developing.

    <h2 style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">About film series</h2>

    <br>

    <p>
        Any breakthrough is first conceived in imagination. For the world to act upon a vision, people need to first and foremost arrive at the insights necessary for its realization. One of the most powerful tools of expression at the moment are films and storytelling. Therefore, to create film series that aim to tell the story of cooperative social formations with greater inclusion and smarter democracy can be the first step.

        <br><br>
        
        Through interviews, narrator voice, thought experiments & animations the films can tell the story in visual and engaging way and make more complex concepts easier to comprehend. "Thought experiment" fragments can through short stories encourage viewers to entertain a perspective that can lead to great revelations about how our world works and how it all could work. The show will strive to embrace the Socratic method which is all about getting people to come to realizations on their own by asking questions that make people think for themselves. Such insights are much more potent than trying to explain things which people often dismiss and which often brings in the “curse of knowledge” which is a term for when communication fails because the other part does not possess the same web of knowledge.

        <br><br>
        
        The films aim to express the story through personalities from cooperative & decentralized social formations. Exploring the potential of such social formations to form a global union à la EU with greater economic and socio-cultural power that can become a new force to push for a world that we all dream about… a world with greater prosperity, peace and global cooperation in all great challenges and opportunities that we face.

    <p>
        The next step is creating a demo episode. Let’s explore cooperation opportunities! If you’re a person who would want to contribute to this vision or if you know any other entities that could help in the realization of it, you’re welcome to reach out or share it further.

        "How do you solve problems that extend beyond your own lifespan? That question may be the essence of civilization. The only answer I can find... is... to initiate a process, to create an environment in which the solutions will occur independently of yourself... but... that requires a difficult sacrifice. Letting go of your desire to exist at the center of the cosmos. To participate in the project of civilization... is to accept... your impermanence." -Slightly edited version of Alexandra Drennan's time capsule from The Talos Principles.
